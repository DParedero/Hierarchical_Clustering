# Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering


## Introduction

The objective is to develop a version of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. This algorithm generates a hierarchical structure in the form of a tree, with the root node being the cluster that contains the greatest number of elements and the leaf nodes being the clusters with the least number of elements. Specifically, as it is an agglomerative algorithm, the procedure will start from the leaf nodes to form ever larger clusters until reaching the root node. In order to implement the algorithm, it is also necessary to develop a specific library of functions that calculates the distances within the topologies of the clusters.

This algorithm is one of the machine learning techniques known as unsupervised learning, that looks for previously undetected patterns in a dataset with no pre-existing labels and setting the clusters as labels.

### Use Cases
The project looks to address the main objective of given a data set, obtaining a dendrogram that classifies the data clusters from most similar to least similar based on certain established metrics that translate the distance into similarity.
